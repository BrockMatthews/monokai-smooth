# Monokai Vibrant Theme
### A very dark and overly vibrant Monokai theme with italicized keywords and operators.

![Monokai Vibrant JavaScript Example](https://hostr.co/file/970/NeYpe5hlnybz/ScreenShot2017-08-27at2.44.34PM.png)

* Super dark and cool editor color scheme
* Retina burning colors
* Italicized keywords and operators compliments "Operator Mono" or similar fonts
* Customized for Markdown, JavaScript and CSS/Sass/Less/Etc (Not so great coloring for Diff yet)

**Enjoy!**
